# Sentiment-Analysis
This project focuses on sentiment analysis using three popular NLP tools: TextBlob, VADER, and Hugging Face Transformers. By leveraging each tool's strengths, this project demonstrates their effectiveness in classifying the sentiment of various text inputs.
Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying the emotional tone of a given text. This project compares three sentiment analysis techniques:

TextBlob: A simple, rule-based tool.
VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner): A lexicon-based approach specifically designed for social media.
Hugging Face Transformers: A deep learning-based approach using pretrained language models.
